Information about available containers, installation and modification can be found on the [Bioconductor Docker Page](http://bioconductor.org/help/docker/).

### General Docker Usage

#### List which docker machines are available locally
    docker images
#### List running containers
    docker ps
#### List all containers
    docker ps -a
#### Get container IP address
    docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' <name>
#### Keep a container running at startup
    docker run -itd <name>
#### Shutdown container
    docker stop <name>
#### Resume container
    docker start <name>

#### Delete container
    docker rm <name>
#### Shell into a running container with either of the following:
    docker exec -it <name> /bin/bash
    docker attach <name>

#### Building and modifying the Bioconductor docker images

The BioC Dockerfiles are not directly edited. Instead, 
for each biocView, there is a common `Dockerfile.in`,
from which two output files for `release` and `devel` files are generated by running 
the `rake` command.

E.g. the `Dockerfile` for the BioC development branch for Proteomics packages 
is created from `src/proteomics/Dockerfile.in` and placed into 
`out/devel_proteomics/Dockerfile`. To build e.g. the `devel_core` image, run


````
cd out/devel_core
docker build -t bioconductor/devel_core . 
````
